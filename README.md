# Path-planning-of-Mobile-robots-in-Webots-simulation
In this project we perform path planning of Mobile Robots(FireBird - VI) in Webots simulation environment. 
We have implemented obstacle detection using image processing and implemented A-Star path planning algorithm on the generated obstacle grid.

The project needs to be run in webot simulation environment. Please go through the "Instructions to run project" before executing the project in Webots.
